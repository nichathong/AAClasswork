# When approaching each problem, make sure to:

# Read the entire problem statement.
# Talk with your partner to identify test cases and key functionality to expect from your code.
# Write RSpec tests.
# Write the method you now have tests for. Follow the red-green-refactor approach until all specs pass.

# Remove dups
# Array has a uniq method that removes duplicates from an array. It returns the unique elements in the order in which they first appeared:

# [1, 2, 1, 3, 3].uniq # => [1, 2, 3] 
# Write your own version of this method called my_uniq; it should take in an Array and return a new array.
